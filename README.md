# Didact
The open source, standalone, fullstack .NET job orchestrator that we've been missing.

## About

This repository will serve as the final release repository for Didact's multi-component backend.

I will utilize the other, multiple repos for Didact's architecture as git submodules and reference them in this final repository.

For docker purposes, the final docker builds for Didact will take place from this repository.
